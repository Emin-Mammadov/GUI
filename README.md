# GUI
This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for handling images. The application is built with PyQt5 and pyqtgraph modules. It allows the user to load an image from their computer, display it, and save it (either with the shortcut CTRL+S or with the button "Save the file") to their desktop. The user can also drag and drop an image onto the application window for display.

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
3. Install the required modules using the following command: pip install PyQt5 pyqtgraph imageio
4. Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository.
5. Run the following command to launch the application: python main.py
6. Once the application window appears, you can load an image by clicking the "Load a file" button and selecting an image file from your computer. The selected image will be displayed in the window.
7. To save the displayed image, click the "Save the file" button. The image will be saved to your desktop with the file name "saved.png".
8. You can also drag and drop an image file onto the application window. The dropped image will be displayed in the window.

Note: The application supports image files with the extensions ".jpg" and ".png".
